# 🎮 (WIP) Game Client

The GameClient is the central hub of all client-side logic and services for the card game. It handles everything from authentication to deck management and communication with the actual game server (via a native C++ bridge). Think of it as the brain — every other part of the game answers to it.

## 📝 TODO
- [ ] Custom Exceptions
- [ ] Finish SynapseNet (C++ bridge between client and server)
- [ ] Create MatchMaking server
- [ ] Figure out the Card Model (in all microservices)
